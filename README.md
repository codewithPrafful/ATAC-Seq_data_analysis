# ATAC-Seq_data_analysis

This repo contains the work I have done under the subject called Computational Epigenetics. It contain the analysis of the ATAC-seq data from the mouse genome (mm18)
using Nextflow pipelines and chrAccR followed by the differential and integrative analysis with other fellow students from various groups (Chip-seq, RNA-seq, and WGBS). This repository also a html file as a documentation of the work I my partner did and Q/A of all the questions from the pdf of this subject. 

I am attaching the html file and the pdf of the work and script that I followed.
